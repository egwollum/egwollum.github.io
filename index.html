		<h1>Hello! My name is Emily.</h1>
		<p>I am a programming and development student interested in accessibility. I also enjoy video games, such as Minecraft, Genshin Impact, and Rail Route. My favorite color combination is red and black (as shown on this page!) and I'm excited to see how this page turns out once I finish the html for it :)
